# copycat
a tool to copy text from PC to android mobile

This is an android tool to those more prefer inputting text from PC than mobile.
It uses netty(https://netty.io) to setup a https sever on mobile and copy the received text
in the clipboard.

It just a testing tool on my way to learn android programming, hope it's useful :)
